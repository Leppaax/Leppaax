## Hello fellas ğŸ‘‹ 
### I'm Leppaax, a second year software development student at tredu, Tampere.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on school projects and on a smart home automation control panel.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react and other stuff.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started to study coding, becouse my old teacher said I have some light inside of me.
